                <h3>üèØ Japanese Innovation: From Tradition to Technology</h3>
                
                <p>Japan's remarkable transformation is admired by people worldwide. Traditional crafts are still preserved by skilled artisans, while cutting-edge technology is developed by innovative companies. The famous bullet train (Shinkansen) was introduced in 1964 and has been continuously improved since then.</p>
                
                <p>Many Japanese traditions are respected and maintained across generations. Tea ceremony is performed with precise movements that have been passed down for centuries. Meanwhile, robots are being designed by Japanese engineers to assist with daily tasks and elderly care.</p>
                
                <p>Japanese anime and manga are enjoyed by millions of fans globally. These cultural products are translated into dozens of languages and are watched in countries around the world. The influence of Japanese pop culture can be seen everywhere, from fashion trends that are inspired by Tokyo street style to video games that are played by people of all ages.</p>
                
                <p>Environmental consciousness is also promoted by Japanese society. Recycling systems are implemented in every community, and energy-efficient technologies are constantly developed. The concept of "mottainai" (avoiding waste) is taught from childhood and is applied in both personal and business practices.</p>
